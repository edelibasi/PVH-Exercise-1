# PVH-Exercise-1

- Configured the project for pods but refrained from downloading any because it was discouraged.
- Created a detail view component which can be used in the next exercises as well.
- Created constraints programmatically as I feel comfortable doing them. Could have used auto layout for cleaner code but wanted to show all my skills in these exercises.
- Used a few extensions for cleaner code.
